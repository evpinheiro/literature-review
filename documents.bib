abstract = {Vehicle scheduling is a crucial step of the public transport planning process because it results in the number of vehicles required, thus it is directly related to fixed cost and labor cost. It is desirable, therefore, to minimize the number of vehicles used and operational cost. This paper proposes a new methodology for the multiple vehicle types vehicle scheduling problem (MVT- VSP). The methodology is based on a minimum-cost network flow model utilizing sets of Pareto-optimal timetables for individual bus lines. Given a fixed fleet size the suggested methodology also allows a selection of the optimal timetable. The method developed enables to stipulate the use of a particular vehicle type for a trip or to allow for a substitution either by a larger vehicle or a combination of smaller vehicles with the same or higher total capacity. Moreover, a variation of the method portrayed makes it possible to construct sub-optimal timetables given a reduction of the vehicle-scheduling cost. It is demonstrated that a substitution of vehicles is beneficial and can lead to significant cost reductions in the range of more than 27{\%}. The suggested methodology is applied to a real-life case study in Auckland, New Zealand, and the results show improvements of greater than 15{\%} in terms of the cost of fleet compared with vehicle schedules that are provided by standard models. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = { This study proposes an improved model and algorithm for the large-scale multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVSP) with departure-duration restrictions. In this study, the time-space network is applied to model the large-scale MDVSP. Considering that crews usually change shifts in the depot, departure-duration restrictions are added to the classic set-partitioning model to ensure that buses return to the depot when crews reach their working time limits. By embedding a preliminary exploring tactic to the shortest path faster algorithm (SPFA), researchers developed an improved large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm to solve large-scale instances of MDVSP with departure-duration restrictions. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-life case in China and several test instances. The results show that the improved LNS algorithm can achieve very good performance in computational efficiency without deteriorating solution quality, which is important for large-scale systems. More specifically, the total cost of the improved LNS algorithm is approximately equal to branch-and-price, but the computational time is much shorter in the case study. For test instances with different number of timetabled trips (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000), the Quality Gap ( QG ) is very small, approximately 0.35{\%}, 0.38{\%}, 0.63{\%}, and 0.93{\%}, while the Efficiency Ratio ( ER ) reaches up to 2.89, 2.98, 3.65, and 3.79, respectively. },

abstract = {The multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVSP) with a single vehicle type considers the assignment of timetabled trips to homogeneous vehicles that are stationed at different depots. The assignment of trips to a vehicle also provides a schedule for a vehicle. The objective is to minimise the total cost due to waiting and travelling empty while covering all the trips. In this paper, we propose a new formulation for the MDVSP (termed as the inventory formulation) that uses assignment arcs in a multi-commodity time-space network flow formulation. A general way to solve this multi-commodity network flow problem is to decompose the problem for each commodity (in this case, for each depot). However, we apply Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition to the inventory formulation by decomposing it for each trip. Column generation is used to solve the linear relaxation of the trip-based decomposition. Column generation requires less time to solve the new trip-based decomposition than the existing depot-based decompositions. To obtain a good-quality integer solution to the MDVSP, we propose a solution framework that solves the linear relaxation of the MDVSP iteratively. At each iteration, schedules for certain vehicles in the fleet are finalised. The iterations continue until all the trips receive an allocation. Three different heuristics are proposed based on the solution framework. The computational experiments suggest that the new heuristics provide better quality solutions than the existing heuristics. For instances with a large number of trips, the new heuristics provide solutions in less time than that required by the existing heuristics.},

abstract = {The multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVSP) has been widely studied in the context of public transit systems. Given a timetable of bus trips, it consists of finding a set of bus schedules that covers every trip exactly once while satisfying vehicle availability at each depot and minimizing the operating costs. This work considers a generalization of the MDVSP that allows slight modifications of the trip scheduled start times. By shifting some trips, one can indeed expect to cover all trips with fewer vehicles or less expensive deadheads (vehicle moves without passengers). However, reducing the operational costs in this way should not be too detrimental to the overall quality of the timetable and, therefore, the following criteria should be controlled: the number of shifted trips, the headways between the consecutive trips of a line, and the quality of some passenger connections. To solve this generalized problem, we develop a two-phase matheuristic: the first phase computes vehicle schedules with a column-generation heuristic; the second relies on a mixed integer program to find the best possible timetable considering the computed vehicle schedules. Penalties are introduced in the first phase to increase the chances of finding a better-quality timetable in the second phase. Computational tests on real-life datasets from a bus company show that the proposed matheuristic can solve the problem efficiently, yielding solutions with a significant reduction in the number of vehicles used compared to the solutions of the classical MDVSP and a limited alteration of the timetable.},

Large instances of the MDVTSP (involving thousands of trips and several depots and vehicle types) are still difficult to solve in a reasonable time. We introduce a heuristic framework, combining time-space network, truncated column generation (TCG) and state space reduction, to solve large instances of the MDVTSP. Extensive testing was carried out using random generated instances, in which a peak demand distribution was defined based on real-world data from public transportation systems in Brazil. Furthermore, experiments were carried out with a real instance from a Brazilian city. The framework has been implemented in several algorithm variants, combining different developed preprocessing procedures, such as state space reduction and initial solutions for the TCG. Computational results show that all developed algorithms obtained very good performances both in quality and efficiency. The best solutions, considering simultaneously quality and efficiency, were obtained in the heuristics involving state space reduction.},

The vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) is concerned with determining the most efficient allocation of vehicles to carry out all the trips in a given timetable. The duration of each trip (called trip time) is normally assumed to be fixed. However, in practice, the trip times vary due to the variability of traffic, driving conditions, and passengers' behavior. It is therefore difficult to adhere to the compiled schedule. This paper proposes a new VSP model based on variable trip times. Instead of being a fixed value, the duration of a trip falls into a time range that can be easily set based on the schedulers' experience or the data collected by automatic vehicle location systems. Within this range, an expected trip time is provided according to the schedulers' expectation of on-time performance. This new model can reduce schedulers' pressure on setting fixed scheduled trip times. Moreover, computational results generated using CPLEX show that this model can increase the on-time performance of resulting schedules without increasing the fleet size.},

abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic approach to the vehicle scheduling problem. We discuss the potential benefit of our approach compared to the traditional one, where the vehicle scheduling problem is solved only once for a whole period and the travel times are assumed to be fixed. In our dynamic approach, we solve a sequence of optimization problems, where we take into account different scenarios for future travel times. Because in the multiple-depot case we cannot solve the problem exactly within reasonable computation time, we use a "cluster- reschedule" heuristic where we first assign trips to depots by solving the static problem and then solve dynamic single-depot problems. We use new mathematical formulations of these problems that allow a fast solution by standard optimization software. We report on the results of a computational study with real life data, in which we compare different variants of our approach and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to deviations of the actual travel times from the estimated ones.},

abstract = {We compare the linear programming relaxation of different mathematical formulations for the multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem. As a result of this theoretical analysis, we select for development a tree search procedure based on a multicommodity network flow formulation that involves two different types of decision variables: one type is used to describe the connections between trips, in order to obtain the vehicle blocks, while the other type is related to the assignment of trips to depots. We also develop a branch and bound algorithm based on the linear relaxation of a more compact multicommodity network flow formulation, in the sense that it contains just one type of variable and fewer constraints than the previous model. Computational experience is presented to compare the two algorithms},

abstract = {Vehicle scheduling always plays an important role in urban mass transit companies. Efficient schedules of a given timetable have a significant influence on the demand for vehicles and, hence, the demand for personnel. This means that the economic results of a urban mass transit company are closely linked to the planning activities in this area. The objective of the paper is to show the state of the research in vehicle scheduling and its practical application in urban mass transit companies. First a brief outline of the historical developments is given. Subsequently, different retrictions for the vehicle scheduling problem are structured and explained. Some models and their mathemati- cal formulation are described, whereby the questions of incorporating restrictions is an important issue. A depiction of solution possibilities offered by program systems for computer-aided scheduling in operational use and expierences from urban mass transit companies complete the remarks},

We describe in detail the basic ingredients of our approach that seem indispensable to solve truly large-scale problems to optimality, and we report on computational investigations that are based on real-world instances of three large German public transportation companies. These instances have up to 25,000 timetabled trips and 70 million integer decision variables. Compared to the results obtained with one of the best planning system currently available in practice, our test runs indicate savings of several vehicles and a cost reduction of about 10{\%}.},

abstract = {A utilidade dos produtos n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} o {\'{u}}nico fator determinante nas decis{\~{o}}es de compra dos consumidores, na medida em que os significados simb{\'{o}}licos carregados pelos bens tamb{\'{e}}m exercem papel fundamental nesse processo. Estes significados podem ser tanto idiossincr{\'{a}}ticos, quanto comumente partilhados com outros consumidores. Al{\'{e}}m disso, podem ser utilizados pelos indiv{\'{i}}duos para sustentar a sua imagem ou criar uma nova representa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de si mesmos. O presente estudo buscou investigar o processo de constru{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de significados agregados ao consumo de vinhos por um grupo de mulheres que dividem h{\'{a}}bitos, compartilham gostos e opini{\~{o}}es por meio da pr{\'{a}}tica de rituais. Esses eventos deram origem {\`{a}} forma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de uma confraria do vinho na Serra Ga{\'{u}}cha. Neste contexto, destaca-se a presen{\c{c}}a de dois fen{\^{o}}menos: o primeiro referente ao aumento do consumo de vinhos pelos brasileiros, tornando o produto mais popular e acess{\'{i}}vel para um n{\'{u}}mero maior de pessoas; o segundo fen{\^{o}}meno diz respeito {\`{a}} forma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e prolifera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o das chamadas “confrarias do vinho” – grupos de indiv{\'{i}}duos que se re{\'{u}}nem basicamente para degustar e estudar as caracter{\'{i}}sticas e propriedades dos vinhos. A fim de atingir o prop{\'{o}}sito do estudo, uma pesquisa qualitativa e explorat{\'{o}}ria foi conduzida. Os materiais disponibilizados pela confraria e os depoimentos de tr{\^{e}}s de suas integrantes serviram de base para a an{\'{a}}lise dos resultados do estudo e foram interpretados atrav{\'{e}}s da an{\'{a}}lise de discurso. Al{\'{e}}m de incentivar o conv{\'{i}}vio social, a aprecia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o ao vinho promove a troca de experi{\^{e}}ncias e o aprendizado sobre o universo hist{\'{o}}rico-cultural da bebida. Consequentemente, a partir da organiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da confraria, novos grupos de consumidoras e formadoras de opini{\~{o}}es se desenvolvem. Dentre os principais resultados, constatou-se que a confraria exerce papel fundamental na mudan{\c{c}}a do estilo de vida das participantes. Por meio dela, as mulheres reafirmam o seu papel na sociedade, conquistando o seu espa{\c{c}}o em uma {\'{a}}rea tradicionalmente dominada pelos homens. Portanto, al{\'{e}}m de ser uma bebida familiar para elas, o vinho se torna um s{\'{i}}mbolo de intelectualidade, poder, desafio, prazer, socializa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e hobby.},

abstract = {We give a new formulation to the multiple-depot vehicle scheduling problem as a set partitioning problem with side constraints, whose continuous relaxation is amenable to be solved by column generation. We show that the continuous relaxation of the set partitioning formulation provides a much tighter lower bound than the additive bound procedure previously applied to this problem. We also establish that the additive bound technique cannot provide tighter bounds than those obtained by Lagrangian decomposition, in the framework in which it has been used so far. Computational results that illustrate the robustness of the combined set partitioning-column generation approach are reported for problems four to five times larger than the largest problems that have been exactly solved in the literature. Finally, we show that the gap associated with the additive bound based on the assignment and shortest path relaxations can be arbitrarily bad in the general case, and as bad as 50{\%} in the symmetric case.},
